## Requirements

This map requires the mod Copper 1.20v mod for Quake.

You can download the version of the jam as that would be the final and official, this one will be the source from my end or any micro patch.

Just download the source file (go to code and Download as ZIP) and download all files into your rm1.1 folder (this even depends how the folder it's named on your end) so well, that's it.
## The making of the maps and Facts

### About the map (the making of and facts)
Very little i could say about this map, i've had some stressful situations and i wanted to start using Makkon's Textures, for either my good or bad luck i used them well except the Trimsheets... the original map got bigger due to myself overspamming the textures, the original map was around 100MB and the music track was basically a wav file around 30 MBs.

The map was pretty much functional so i had to retexture it and i did within a day.

I wanted to do a small horror map, so Ahioren's Nightmare came to my mind, the idea was kinda a horror house/industrial-concrete building that basically had small abstract elements... of course making horror in Quake is difficult and i could have used more tricks but i decided to make it short.

I was a bit overwhelmed but i was fully committed to retexture my map, CommonCold (a great friend who has always helped me on map making, hoping more collabs in the future) basically grabbed all the old map version's textures and compiled them in a .wad file removing and keeping the most important.

Said .wad file is in the github if you wanna check em out, altho there are some unused that are not compiled within the map.
